Readme for new projects

myvenv: accounts for my first virtual environment while I was studying Linda's tutorial for Django.

For the future projects that require more robust virtual environments, I recommend you to term them with significant names, like:

myvenv_sklearn
myvenv_cloudera
et cetera...

Also, it seems you'll need to use a different folder for a future project.
